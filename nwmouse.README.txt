A bit of a kludge to enable usage of a hardware mouse inside
of NWN. 

Portions originally authored by lje/Jens on the NWN forums. 
It was his modification to keep NWN from disabling the HW
cursor that originally started this project. 

Standard Legal Shtuff:

I do not guarentee this to work on any computer, except my own.   If it
should some how allow all the magic smoke to escape your computer, well
tough.  You were warned.   Avoid swimming for at least three hours after
using this product.

What little bit of this that is copyrightable is copywritten by David Holland
david.w.holland@gmail.com.   You may do what you wish with this code so long as
some credit is given to me, and the copyright is maintained.

If someone would like to send me better installation instructions, I'll
gladly update the package with them.   Along with any code
updates.

Flames will be redirected to /dev/null.   As will testy bug reports.
Friendly bug reports will be examined as time permits.

----> enough disclaimers <----

Things required:
gcc 

Perl

libelf, including development headers.

automake

autoconf

libtool

XFree86 4.3 (or later) 

The Xcursor library, and development headers. 

Per user reports, specific requirements for Debian include: 
libelfg0 libelfg0-dev libxcursor1 libxcursor-dev libsdl1.2-dev

If building on x86_64, you will need to install the 32bit 
development libraries.

----

#) Unpack the nwmouse tar.gz file in your NWN directory.  (But you've
   probably already done this, if your reading this file.  :-) )

#) execute ./nwmouse_install.pl to build the source code.

#) modify your 'nwn' startup script to include the following lines:

export XCURSOR_PATH=`pwd`
export XCURSOR_THEME=nwmouse
export LD_PRELOAD=./nwmouse.so

   before executing nwmain

   If your using nwmovies, the line would look something like so: 

export LD_PRELOAD=./nwmovies.so:./nwmouse.so

#) Do not touch the other SDL_MOUSE_RELATIVE, or SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE lines
   they've nothing to do with the hardware mouse.

#) You may wish to do something similar for the 
   dmclient startup script.

#) Enjoy.. 

#) There is a bit of a log file in nwmouse.log.   You may wish to modify
   your nwn startup script to remove it occasionally.

#) Note if a cursor ever shows up that has not been converted, you will 
    get the standard X11 cursor.

    Please check nwmouse.log to see what mouse cursor is missing. 

----> Known Issues <-----

None. 

----> Change Log <----

v3.1 09/06/09 Notes:

Fix a libSDL/NVidia driver related issue.  
Note, I don't play NWN much anymore, nor do I really frequent the forums, so 
I don't support any of these much, sorry. 

END 09/06/09 Notes

v3.0 01/23/08 Notes: 

x86_64 Support, and a slightly changed build proceedure.  
Validated to work with 1.68 1.69b2

Distribute the mouse cursors pre-converted.

My thanks to Eyrdan, and Skildron on the NWN forums for their help
getting this to work on x86_64. 

END 01/23/08 Notes.

02/16/2004 Updated mouse convert script to work w/ both ImageMagick 
   		5.x, and 6.x

v2.2 Notes: 

09/24/2004 Updates for 1.64beta3 (and probably 1.64).

v2.1 Notes: 

Long outstanding rotated mouse cursors not being drawn bug 
finally squash.  Death to Quaternions (or my Trigonometry 
abilities.  Your choice.) 

As always, whack nwmouse.ini when upgrading.

v2.0 Notes:

Uses new and improved technique for overriding the mouse cursors.
(Funny, I finally found a use for C++.) 

You should now _NEVER_ see the software cursor being drawn. 
If you do, then contact me, and I'll probably have to walk 
you through some debugging, as I whack the only mouse cursor
object I know of. 

v1.0 Notes:

Doesn't work real well on i810 graphics adapters.  But then
again NWN isn't real playable on that platform anyways, even
w/ this hack.

Appears to work OK on my NVidia card, even though I don't need
it there.
